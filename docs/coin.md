# Token Details  

**Inspector Elon (IELON)** is designed with long-term value and sustainability in mind. Hereâ€™s how the tokenomics are structured:  

| Property         | Details                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Token Name**    | Inspector Elon          |
| **Symbol**        | IELON                   |
| **Decimals**      | 9                       |
| **Total Supply**  | 500,000,000             |
| **Burnable**      | Yes                     |
| **Minting**       | No further minting to prevent dilution |

With a fixed supply of 500 million tokens, IELON ensures scarcity, and its burnable nature further enhances its deflationary potential over time.
